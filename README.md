The Heroku website can be found here: https://floating-mountain-79343.herokuapp.com/
However, after 30 minutes of inactivity, it is disabled so it will be more reliable to look at the cloud apps site or run locally.

Our client has different documentation, as he will be looking at it from heroku, as opposed to cloud apps. His documentation can be found on our team website under deliverables-->documentation-->Admin documentation
